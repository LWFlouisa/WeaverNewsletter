For those who have followed my newsletter so far, youll know that I've been coming around to the idea that while there very much is a kind of Systemic Racism, it's not the kind of racism we're often presented with. In practice the United States has become a de factor Black Identitarian country, although in ways that no traditional leftist would have any business supporting.

The worst aspect of white identitarianism, is that like with Nazi Germany, eventually this leads to white people eventually cannibalizing itself, because it's ran out of other people to demonize, and that excludes the other shitty things that tend to go along with Fascism ( or even "Privatized Marxism" ) where rather than "Each One According To Their Ability, Each One To Their Need", it is private companies where this dynamic is played out.

Because the United States has become systemically racist against white and asian people, and possibly more Asian people, this essentially means that whatever systemic racism that Asian people experienced is effectively papered over, because apparently Black Americans experienced the worst forms of racism in world history. It should not be lost on anyone where this eventually leads.

And where that wont lead to abolishing all racial hierarchies what so ever, and it certainly will not lead to social welfare services. Ultimately a Black Nationalist / Black Identitarian can not in practice even reasonable think of themselves as anarchist, because this will essentially mean abolishing the concept of nations altogether.

In the mean, my own view on what even constitutes a "white" has broadened over the years. But such views that allow for shades of grey are not even permissible in the dynamic that evolves into a political theory that evolves into an Anti-Asian philosophy. Certainly it is not my intention to replace Black Nationalism or White Nationalism with Asian Nationalism. No form of nationalism is desireable to me. This is why I call myself an Anti-Nationalist. Nationalism by its nature is inherently undesireable.

And that leads me to Linguistic Anti-Nationalism.
