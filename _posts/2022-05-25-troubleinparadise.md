title: Trouble Is Transgender Paradise

There seems to be trouble brewing in transgender paradise, between groups that fight for the rights of cis women, and the rights of people who don't represent the vast majority of trans women and men. In particular, there seems to be a kind of soft civil war between faction who both mutually largely want trans women to be gone. However what can normal transwomen do about this problem?

First, block every genuine TERF that you can, which still essentially means a feminist woman ( this inherently disqualifies Trump from being a TERF ) that you can, including twitter profiles like women_are_human, in particular with a lizard picture in their profile or profile name. This is primarily used as a dog whistle for detransitioners, which is the opposite problem of gender abolitionists.

You can also similarly block trans activists, who as much as they claim to represent trans values, actually care very little about the lives of genuine trans women and men that seek to go the medical route. Sometimes you will find them in anarchist circles, but this isn't necessarily the case. Sometimes you'll find them in grifter communities like Breadtube.

Also block Fascists as well, and the reason is that as bad as Marxists and Anarchist tend to be for trans people, Fascists are almost worse because they've had an actual history of targeting members of the LGBT community, which started around the same period that Antifa had started expanded their reach and influence in trans space.

Also do not be ashamed to self-medicate. I myself may end up being in this situation. But for right now the current enemey of trans women are Fascists, Conservatives, some Liberals, and to a lesser degree also Communists. And in some way the kind of transphobia that persists in Marxist spaces is even more insidious. Because no political faction ultimately has the back of LGBT people.

Note also the recent changes in the LGBT flag. Continue to keep a watch out for a further schism in that activist community, until they eventually pretend like they never advocated for our issues at all. And us normal trans women will be left alone to advocate for ourselves.
