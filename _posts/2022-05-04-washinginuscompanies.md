title: Pink And Red Washing In US Businesses

Pink Washing is the way a corporation engages in celebrating homosexuality and other issues, with the attempt to distract from negative issues happening on the business level. This is how sometimes you'll have companies like Marvel claim to support LGBT issues, while also having traditional conservatives and the religious right be the target audience of disney princess movies. In this sense, they're relying on people not paying attention to the bigger picture of how the main purpose of a corporation is to expand their wealth.

Comicsgate used Pink Washing ( with Rainbow Washing being a successor practice ) as an excuse to basically harass people like myself on social media, but this doesn't mean that the underlying issue is not present. Marvel products, and to a lesser extent, will kind of superficially endorse pro LGBT people, while not really consulting actual trans women about how exactly we wish to be represented, and this is why there able to smear everyone ( even those on the left ) as being White Supremacist, and hoping people ignore the fact that Marvel is a propaganda machine.

The term Pink Washing also frequently overlaps with terms like Rainbow Capitalism, where they incorporate elements of LGBT ideas and concept, in order to expand their market and wealth producing capabilities, despite the fact that once we're not seen as useful to them any longer, they would disgard us in an absolute heartbeat. What expanding the market to include us LGBT people into comics actually does, is paper over the fact that their actual aim is to make an absolute ton of money at comic book shops and movie theatres.

The problem in the past is that frequently the same people that would critique rainbow capitalism, are also the same people that are trying to erase distinctions between male and female, and ironically erroding the reasoning behind ideas like "it's a woman's right to choose", currently playing out in the Row vs Wade protests, do to an admittingly horrible precedent in Washington.

However Marvel and DC, with their tendency to paper over issues like using LGBT people for generating wealth, is in absolutely no position then to critique things like the abolition of Roe vs. Wade, which is an actual issue that needs to be addressed and undone. And the people that seek to erase the distinctions between male and female are largely complicent in undoing the support for their own cause. The solution then is to clean up our own hourse, and not make the idea that it's a woman's right to choose entirely meaningless, but suggesting that trans women like myself, whom are biologically male, are capable of getting pregant and should have a say in the abortion debate.

Before I leave you, there is also a similar issue with Red Washing: https://wikiless.org/wiki/Redwashing?lang=en In these activities an organization, political party, or company / corporation falsely presents themselves as being progressive, while still practicing highly capitalistic things. It's why blogs I found describing German Antifa is starting to seem less and less far fetched to me.

It's bringing me to the idea that maybe German Antifa is an elaborate hybrid of Pink and Red washing.
