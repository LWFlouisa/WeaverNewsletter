## AntiNationalism As A Cure For Personality Cults

The thing about the nature of cults, is that if the person dies often the group will have trouble surviving and have difficulty achieving its aims. Also a cult leader by design concentrates so much power into them, that it is impossible to even propose better approaches for the same ideas. And yet, often times, a cult leader will have a lot of good ideas if updated to the present, and designed to factor in the value systems of the twenty first century. But its tendency to focus all power into one person may be an achilles hell.

One of the observations I've made, when I was in Billy Meier's cult, was that frequently people would try to take advantage of his good nature, and try to distort his message. Frequently that individual would then try to concentrate power into their own personal theories and practice, and that's how you end up with character like Alex Collier:

If you don't know who I'm talking about, consider yourself blessed. Frequently cult leaders will slowly reveal information about how they work, partially in an effort to mitigate against these kinds of bad actors. Although I'm increasingly wondering if there is something inherent to Ufology that tends to attract the most grifters until Breadtube came along.

But there is something to also be said for distributing power as equally as possible within a religious like structure, but this would be an extremely different way of concieving of religion, in a way not that disimlar to unorganized religion such as spirituality. Much of marketing is basically similar to cult recruitment practices after all, and those who like certain consumer goods could be argued to be followers of some kind of religion.

All you have to do is tap into their secret beliefs and desires, and limit access to information except to the initiated in order to create the illussion of mystique about certain goods and services, and then slowly turn them into true believers by making them increasingly dependant on your wisdom. And then create a good vs. evil dynamic.

The consumer of said faith or consumer good must feel persecuted for their beliefs, and this creates further dependance on the guidance of your motherly / fatherlyness in some holy cause. And those who spread the word about said cause would operate without a clear leadership structure, with the intent of slowly phasing out your own influence in the network.

Billy Meier does something insidious though in addition: he creates the illussion that this is being done based on your own free will, and those not familiar with that kind of manipulation can easily be tricked by it. And tends to attract those already feeling nihilism and lost. And so where does Anti-Nationalism as a framework fit into this?

Anti-Nationalism seek to combat the cult of personality dynamics of Charismatic Leaders, without the destructiveness that comes with full anarchism, who often end up coming across as storm troopers than those who will to practically implement policies. And perhaps, ironically the best way to approach that is to make anti-nationalism a kind of decentralized religion.
