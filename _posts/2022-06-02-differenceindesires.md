If you were to put reactionaries and reincarnates side by side, you would be forgiven for thinking that the reincarnate also desires to live with a larger state and government. But there is a difference, technically, being being nostalgic for a place you've never been, and actually desiring the social conservativism that comes with actually living in those periods.

The reactionary seeks to rewind time, and actually take society back to those periods. But the "reincarnate", is made to adjust to rapid technological advance at a rate that they are not accomstomed for, having been born in an earlier century. If you were to take Catherine Howard or Charlotte Corday, it would take an adjustment period to learn how to use cell phones and modern media.

The manifests in the tendency for some reincarnates to actually evolve into a kind of economically left-leaning and social liberalism, but culturally center-right individual, when it comes to individual liberties, and furthermore, valuing individual freedom than may necessarily be typical for someone who is a leftist.

In some cases, a reincarnate may evolve into a full blown tech-junky, depending on how they were raised in a previous century. And this leads to a certain reality I'm not sure the current left-wing movement are really ready to cope with, and neither Reactionaries.

In my mind it is at least possible that some individuals in Amish and Menonite communities, when left to their own devices ( pun not intended ) may actually eventually evolve into socially conservative strains of communism that is extremely skeptical of big government. I suspect no real "reincarnate" would ever take things quit that far, and may develop a fondness for modern conveniences.

But I feel like that demographic can be better served if the left were more equiped to deal with "Old Communist" types of a libertarian bent.
