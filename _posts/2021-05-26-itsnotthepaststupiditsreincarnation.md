title: Its Not The Past Stupid Its Reincarnation

As a writer of fiction I tend to handle stories about people who do not merely long for the past, but rather in practice have actually reincarnated from the past. This manifest in a very different kind of things, that while the niceties of the future are good, it often means having to adapt and cope to a new and different cultural sensibility.

In general my prefered Time Period, as a writer, is the 1830 in France. Because it provides something far enough way from the world war II era, which for me would honestly be to depressing. But also it's near enough in the future where having a MC adapt to the present is something that would in essence actually be a doable thing.

I had previously wrote Cyberpunk, but it never dealt with the more metaphysical and paranormal issues, such as for example: at times feeling like I've been reincarnated from the past, and forced to adapt to a present with technology that I'm not prepared for. And this often means coping with learning how to use technology without any kind of formal help.

And this comes to why I always pick serial murderesses. In general while there are female serial killers, in general in most cases they often carry out their murders in a different way from men, and often it comes from a long periuod of abuse, and generally lashing out against me. And it often aligns with this mixed feelings I've had about capital punishment for years. In particular why is it am I drawn to movies about beheading, and yet find the actual practice abhorent.

Such a dynamic as I've come to learn, is not about traditional politics. Or longing for the past. It's feeling like I've reincarnated from the past, with my lover a serial murderess.
