## A Matriarchal  "Soft Dictatorship"
### By S.R. Weaver

To be clear this is for my next novel. I generally find anything more than a mini state abhorant.

---

Leaders take on the figure of a bonevolent "Mother" figure.

Socially liberal ( pro lgbt ) with the exception of gun owning. Fashion is reverted to a modernized 19th century French or Swiss.

Partial global confederation of micronations, that vote federally based on consensus.

Individual micronations are free to trade with other member states, including those who leave the union.

Sovereignty rests upon the ability to reason and make rational decisions. Each micronation has sovereignty on most social affairs, but not on death penalty implementation.

Antimilitarism and actively fight against the death penalty applied to civilians, but permissable for "war crimes" done with French or Japanese methods of late 19th century: guillotine, beheading by katana, or slow hanging.

Member micronations whose leadership makes decisions that endanger the population must be executed on live television. And residents are given permanent residence in other member states unconditionally.

Only women are allowed in leadership roles and the military.

Genetic engineering is allowed for producing "perfect children" who grow up to become powerful leaders. Everyone else does it vaginally.

Top performing students are trained in high school to become symbols of innocense, and everything good in leadership, and organize meetings in government on a round table.
