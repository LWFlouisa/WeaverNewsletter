## Racism Of Post Modern Theories

Anarchism built on Post Modernism theories by Hubert Mercuse becomes a hierarchy that prioritizes black lives over virtually every other minority group. LGBs? Trans women? Nevermind whether some of us are feminine or masculine presenting, post modernism sucks up everything under its vaccuum and forces their artificial culture on us.

This becomes problematic when the only issue you disagree with the left is about Post Modernism. It ignores subtler kinds of racial deacrimination like French girls dating Asian woman, and the issues they face: apparently being a trans woman that doesnt change how her issues are seen as less worthy of examination than black people.

This is the kind of ironic ( or possibly intentionally anti-Asian and anti-Jewish ) racism that post modernism contributes: an extreme hierarchy that prefers black people over anyone else.

Could you imagine if a white trans woman did the same thing? Inserting her white trans woman culture into pop culture. Its already known white men do that all the time. And yet trans women are suppose to just sit back and let themselves get fucked by these people, when you would think a multiracial couple with one a trans woman, would get some benefits.

And the weirdest thing is anarchists, of all people, end up tolerating this hierarchy, which is becoming less and less like a soft hierarchy.

White Trans Anarchists need to start calling out the bullshit this overwhelming preference for black people it is, especially when the theory itself was written by a white guy who has none of these traits: Hubert Marcuse.

And that doesnt exclude other forms of advocacy post modernism has tried consuming. More on that later.

Sorry Fred Hampton, but your a Cis Black Male. But unlike you, I dont consider any race superior to any other.

You can hear these anti German, anti French, anti-Italian people seeth because to them there is only black and white theories of descrimination. Making my own efforts to overcome my issues with French people basically pointless.

We need a great awakening for Southern Europeans and Asian people.
