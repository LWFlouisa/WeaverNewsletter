title: What's With The Series Name?

What's with the name Charlotte De Olympus Mons? The first portion of my name comes from a nick name I recieved when I was in high school. My friend from computer class called me Olympus Mons, and formed for a group called The Clit. Yes I know, the name. But we would hang out after school and go to quarries, and plan dungeon and dragons along with Diablo. You would think then that would be closer to my target audience.

I had always been fascinated by the story of Charlotte Corday, and to a lesser extent also Sophie Scholl. Charlotte Corday is interesting because rather than as part of a team, she alone unlike other royalists took the plunge and attempt to prevent the rein of terror of the guillotine. Although this does not come with mixed feelings, as along with Joan D'Arc had been coopted by the National Front. But I assure that's not my fondness.

I came up with the name Charlotte De Olympus Mons as I see myself becoming increasingly a blend of my high school self, and elements of Charlotte Corday, but rather on the left. Not in terms of anti-revolutionary sentiment, but in the desire to act alone in the wild, and be free to do my own thing. And take personal steps to resolve issues that may arise rather than through Mob Rule or Big Government.

For the rogue individual has more in common with the Ronins of ages of Samurai past, then they ever will with Organized Crime or alternative government systems such as state capitalism. Because of this I have some sympathies with Charlotte Corday in terms of the desire to take direct initiative on the forces of my life outside of my own control, even if the desire is not to overturn the established order.

This next series will venture into rogue investigator territory, revolving around different types of Serial Killers and Spree Killers in the past, and the various theories about the relationship between Organized Crime, Serial Killers, and Bloated Government.
