title: Target Audience Studies

Over the last few days sense I started using youtube again, I've noticed a shift in who seems to be my target audience. For those who don't know, I'm a writer of Gothic Romance that sometimes shifts into Tech Noir territory. Frequently the MCs are often either state executioners and serial murderess, and the states attempt to seperate them from their love for each other. On the other hand it often ends up drifting into cyberpunk territory do to my previous influence being works like Neuromancer.

When I looked at my analytics, it turns out that much of my current audience is 18-24 ( around the age I was thinking, which is basically Younger New Adult, more on that later ) and over the last 90 days have shifted toward women in India. So this has made me curious, even though I've shifted into a minarcho-socialist ( I call it Post-Monetary Anti-Market Green Bartering ) if there are actually anarchist currents in that part of the world.

As it turns out there is an extremely large current anarchist traditions over there. I'm not sure if that has much to do with, as the only time I've implied an interest in anarchist was in one image where Hemato met up with a friend when she returned back home. I've noticed also my poetry seems to get views than my short stories and novels, which is...something to think about for sure.

But there is a possibility there is a subset of women in India that are into Anarchist and Minarchist topics. I think the main reason I hadn't considered marketing to them, is my main interest is in Southern European ( especially France and Italy ) cultures, and East Asian cultures like Korea and Japan.

But it doesn't seem like Gothic romance would be something that would appeal to them, and yet one of the shows recommended to me was a I-Drama starring a MC that was a vampire.

So all that to say is, don't rule out seemingly unlikely demographics.
