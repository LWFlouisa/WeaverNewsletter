C'EST NE VIE POUR MES MME

At midnight the girl dreams of widow blades hanging on the wall. At midnight she in her sleep, longs for midnight forest seeking death. From petrified forests and to distant prairies, one may think one can find a tombstone with the ancient fairies.

In life she jots words of some distant lover from afar. And yet all those dreams, now once held in a jar fade away like distant sand. She had wanted to live along the coast, and yet do to expenses, this was to much. For she made herself a bet, how much longer with the art supplies last.

She like dark haired beauties, with a nice chest, and a smaller booty. From Alsace all the way to the Basque. As a writer, she wondered, how much longer till her dreams could last. For she lived outside of time, flowing like a music box melody. Without this sweet song she was aghast.

Yet the wooden shoes, along her wicker door, reminded her of a flower girl, from the years of yore.

Along the river the wooden shoes made imprints, and she dug natural pigments from the dirt. The clothes she sat in the grass, so the wind would not lift up her skirt. It was once her mother’s miniskirt, before she left this world behind. And leaving her a music box with broken rhymes.

At night she dreams of game characters, Once she found more companionship, then with other humans or even pets. Real life was filled with parental lectures. And having tied her to own LGBT issues, she found that over time said Cathedral represented rejection of her specifically.

In France there was the commune of 1871, and elsewhere in Alsace came the Soviets. Yet her in the present was only a memory, Clinging onto to the past, like one does revolution.

Yet for Mme Belle, c’est ne cette vie. But the life of memories.

That one can never get back.
