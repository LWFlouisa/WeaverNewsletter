Contrary to how the radical left presents itself, rather than seeking to abolish all racial hierarchies, what has happened is they've replaced the hierarchy that supposedly white culture has created ( more on this later ), even there it has become my belief that even within white people there are several racial subsets within them: Spanish, French, and Italians are the most obvious. But in Europe white people are defined differently, and that's why people with radically different skin tons are lumped in as being causasian. And yet radical leftism, and specifically Critical Race Theory, that promotes that all of societies ills have been caused by the white man, with obvious anti-simetic implications.

That's not to say that I don't believe there is systemic racism. But what I've come to believe is that society is systemically racist against white and Asian people, rather than against black people, and even anything it is African Americans that have latched onto the levers of power. When they try to present systemic racism always being targeted at black power, they cover up the minor systemic racism that off-white people experience, including by not limited to Asian Americans, and people who they label as honorary white: how Critical Race Theory targets Jewish people being another example.

Ok so we got that out of the way, but notice what I'm implying: the problem is rather than completely smashing the social distinctions between the races, what Critical Race Theory has done is justified a form of systemic racism against white culture, despite the fact that there isn't really one kind of white people, especially in Europe. An argument could be made that, for example, an Anglo-Saxon hating French people is in some ways closer to racism than it is to plain old bigotry. But an olive toned French girl with one Spanish and one German parent would not traditionally be included in standard Critical Race Theory.

I don't even really advocate the idea of creating an alternative critical race theory, which is in some ways what the Dark Enlightment inevitably leads to in some of its darker variations. But I will say I didn't make a personal effort to overcome my issues about Spanish and French girls, only to have society tell me that Spanish and French girls do not experience a form of racism themself, even if the way it manifests is different. After all even the left acknowledged the existance of non-race based minorities.

And yet now what's happened is that often implied but not stated, is that someone simply cannot experience sexism, homophobia, or transphobia, or other forms of bigotry without also being black. Moreover to cover up this fact they artificially create histories of "black Danish" people, as if somehow these were native Danes rather than simply people the Danes have brought over. ( I'm not saying this happened, but rather using this as an example. )

Because the radical left has made everything based on race, it ironically prevents overcoming racial issues that are less obvious. Or that whose racial characteristics isn't based on the color of their skin. Which says a lot of things, but that race is a social construct is not it. And so much of left-wing anarchism has bought into these theories hook, line, and sinker.

This puts me in a weird position if I want a Japanese wife with a French accent as a trans woman.
